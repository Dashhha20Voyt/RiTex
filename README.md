# RiTex
 RiTex (Riemannian Texture harmonization) method based on the geometry of a variety of symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices. The method integrates affine invariant metrics, the Frechet mean on a Riemannian manifold, and a generalized eigenvalue problem for stable estimation of covariance structures of various batches.
